## Greetings ðŸ‘‹.

Welcome to the source code of [mwskwong.com](https://mwskwong.com). You can see how I created my site here.

## PROD Deployment

1. Create a PR from `canary` to `main`. Let the GitHub Actions run automatically.

2. In [Contentful](https://app.contentful.com/)

   1. Update the `master` alias target to the untargeted canary environment (check the **Created** date, it should be newer than the currently targeted environment).

   2. Delete the untargeted canary environment (i.e. the one previously targeted by `master`) and add a new one.

      - Environment ID naming: `canary_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.mm.ss.SSSZ`

        ```js
        `canary_${new Date().toISOString().replaceAll(":", ".")}`;
        ```

      - Cloned from: `development` environment

   3. Update the **Environments** of the `canary` API key, check the newly added canary environment

3. In [Vercel](https://vercel.com), replace the value of environment variable `CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT` of the **Preview** environment to the Contentful Environment ID defined in step 2.ii.

4. Merge/enable auto merge for the PR.

## Preview Deployment

1. Create a PR to `canary` (optional)

2. In [Contentful](https://app.contentful.com/)

   1. Delete the latest canary environment and add a new one.

      - Environment ID naming: `canary_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.mm.ss.SSSZ`

        ```js
        `canary_${new Date().toISOString().replaceAll(":", ".")}`;
        ```

      - Cloned from: `development` environment

   2. Update the **Environments** of the `canary` API key, check the newly added canary environment

3. Perform step 3 of [PROD Deployment](#prod-deployment)

4. Merge the PR or push code changes to `canary` directly
